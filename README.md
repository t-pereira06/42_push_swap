# push_swap
This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for an optimized data sorting.

## How To Compile and Execute:
To compile the project:
```bash
$ make
```
After compiling, execute the program, followed by numbers to order:
```bash
$ ./push_swap <number1> <number2> ...
```
After executing the program, the movements made by the program will appear in the terminal:
```bash
$ ./push_swap 3 2 1 4 5
pb
pb
pa
sa
rra
rra
pa
ra
ra
ra
```
If you want to check how many moves the program did to organize the numbers, execute:
```bash
$ ./push_swap 3 2 1 4 5 | wc -l
10
```
After executing the program, if you want to clean the object files, execute:
```bash
$ make fclean
```

## push_swap rules:
The program is only allowed two stacks to work with, stack A and stack B. All the numbers are initially added to stack A, and B is empty.

Moves:

* ```pa``` (push A): Take the first element at the top of B and put it at the top of A. Do nothing if B is empty.
* ```pb``` (push B): Take the first element at the top of A and put it at the top of B. Do nothing if A is empty.
* ```sa``` (swap A): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack A. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements.
* ```sb``` (swap B): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack B. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements.
* ```ss```: ```sa``` and ```sb``` at the same time.
* ```ra``` (rotate A): Shift all elements of stack A up by 1. The first element becomes the last one.
* ```rb``` (rotate B): Shift all elements of stack B up by 1. The first element becomes the last one.
* ```rr```: ```ra``` and ```rb``` at the same time.
* ```rra``` (reverse rotate A): Shift all elements of stack A down by 1. The last element becomes the first one.
* ```rrb``` (reverse rotate B): Shift all elements of stack b down by 1. The last element becomes the first one.
* ```rrr``` : ```rra``` and ```rrb``` at the same time.

Evaluation:

* Sorting 3 values: no more than 3 moves.
* Sorting 5 values: no more than 12 moves.
* Sorting 100 values: rating from 1 to 5 points depending on the number of moves:

  * 5 points for less than 700
  * 4 points for less than 900
  * 3 points for less than 1100
  * 2 points for less than 1300
  * 1 point for less than 1500

* Sorting 500 values: rating from 1 to 5 points depending on the number of moves:

  * 5 points for less than 5500
  * 4 points for less than 7000
  * 3 points for less than 8500
  * 2 points for less than 10000
  * 1 point for less than 11500
